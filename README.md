# MTimer

## Project Description

MTimer is a simple yet effective Android application designed to help users track and manage time-based tasks and events. The app is ideal for users who need to keep track of specific times, such as countdowns, alarms, or timers, and is equipped with features to ensure accurate time management even when the app is closed. Whether you are tracking a countdown, managing a time-sensitive task, or setting reminders, MTimer makes it easy to stay on track.

## Features

- **Timer Setup:** Allows users to set a specific time format (e.g., `xxxx:xx` for hours and minutes) and track time for various activities.
  
- **Background Timer:** The timer continues to run even when the app is closed, ensuring precise tracking without requiring the app to stay open.
  
- **Multiple Timers:** Support for setting multiple timers, enabling users to manage different time-sensitive tasks simultaneously.
  
- **Notifications:** Users are notified when the timer reaches zero, allowing them to act immediately when a task or event concludes.

- **Simple Interface:** The app features a minimalistic and user-friendly interface, making it accessible for users of all technical skill levels.

- **Customizable Alerts:** Users can personalize alarm sounds or vibrations to make sure they are alerted when time runs out.

## User Experience

- **Launch:** Upon opening the app, users are greeted with a simple interface that allows them to set timers with ease.
  
- **Timer Creation:** Users can enter the desired time in the `xxxx:xx` format (hours:minutes) and begin the countdown.
  
- **Timer in the Background:** The app ensures that timers continue running, even when minimized or the app is closed, providing reliability for time-sensitive tasks.

- **Notifications:** Once the timer finishes, users receive an alert notifying them that their time has expired.

## Target Audience

- **Professionals:** Individuals who need a reliable tool for tracking work tasks, meetings, and deadlines.
  
- **Students:** For tracking study sessions, assignments, or exam preparation.
  
- **Home Users:** People who want to manage household tasks, cooking, or other time-sensitive activities.
  
- **Anyone who needs reliable time tracking**: From fitness enthusiasts to people managing events or reminders.

2. **Background Timer:** Timers will keep running even when the app is closed or in the background.
